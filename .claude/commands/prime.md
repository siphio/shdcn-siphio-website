# Prime: Load Project Context

## Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

## Objective

Build comprehensive understanding of the codebase by analyzing structure, documentation, technology research profiles, and key files. Produces a context summary that enables all other PIV commands.

## Reference Files Policy

**Default behavior**: Do NOT read reference files (`.agents/reference/`, `ai_docs/`, `ai-wiki/`, or similar reference directories) in full.

**Exception**: Only read reference files if the arguments explicitly request it (e.g., `--with-refs`, `include references`, `read reference files`).

**Technology Profiles**: Always LIST available profiles in `.agents/reference/` but only read their summaries (first 10 lines). Full profiles are consumed by `/plan-feature` and `/execute`.

Check arguments for keywords: `ref`, `reference`, `--with-refs`, `include ref`

## Reasoning Approach

**CoT Style:** Zero-shot

Before producing the output report, think step by step:
1. Scan codebase structure — file count, directory patterns, languages
2. Cross-reference `.agents/reference/` profiles with `.agents/plans/` progress
3. Assess development progress — what's done, what's pending, any gaps
4. Check artifact freshness — are plans/profiles outdated relative to recent commits?
5. Determine the precise next step based on current PIV loop position

## Hook Toggle

Check CLAUDE.md for `## PIV Configuration` → `hooks_enabled` setting.
If arguments contain `--with-hooks`, enable hooks. If `--no-hooks`, disable.
Strip hook flags from arguments before processing reference file keywords.

## Process

### 1. Analyze Project Structure

List all tracked files:
!`git ls-files`

Show directory structure:
On Linux, run: `tree -L 3 -I 'node_modules|__pycache__|.git|dist|build'`

### 2. Read Core Documentation

- Read CLAUDE.md or similar global rules file
- Read README files at project root and major directories
- Read `.agents/PRD.md` or `PRD.md` (if exists)
- Read any architecture documentation in root or docs/

**Skip these unless arguments explicitly request references:**
- `.agents/reference/` directory (full content)
- `ai_docs/` directory
- `ai-wiki/` directory

### 3. Discover Technology Profiles

Check for research profiles produced by `/research-stack`:

```bash
ls .agents/reference/*-profile.md 2>/dev/null
```

If profiles exist:
- List each profile name and the technology it covers
- Read the first section (Agent Use Case line) from each to understand what's available
- Report profile count and technologies covered
- Note: These are consumed in full by `/plan-feature` and `/execute`

If no profiles exist:
- Note: "No technology profiles found. Run `/research-stack` after PRD creation."

### 4. Identify Key Files

Based on the structure, identify and read:
- Main entry points (main.py, index.ts, app.py, etc.)
- Core configuration files (pyproject.toml, package.json, tsconfig.json)
- Key model/schema definitions
- Important service or controller files

### 5. Understand Current State

Check recent activity:
!`git log -10 --oneline`

Check current branch and status:
!`git status`

### 6. Check Development Progress

If `.agents/plans/` exists:
```bash
ls -t .agents/plans/*.md 2>/dev/null
```
Report which plans exist and their phases.

If `.agents/validation/` exists:
```bash
ls -t .agents/validation/*.md 2>/dev/null
```
Report most recent validation results.

If PRD exists, check the "Current Focus" section for active phase and status.

### 7. Check Execution Memory

If `.agents/memory/` exists:
```bash
ls -t .agents/memory/*.md 2>/dev/null
```

If memory files exist:
- Read each memory file — these are concise (20-40 lines each) and contain critical execution context
- Extract: deviations from plans, discoveries, patterns established, recovery actions, validation learnings
- These inform the "Current State" section of the output report and provide context for downstream commands

If no memory files exist:
- Note: "No execution memory found. Memory is created automatically during `/execute` and `/validate-implementation`."

## Output Report

Provide a concise summary covering:

### Project Overview
- Purpose and type of application
- Primary technologies and frameworks
- Current version/state

### Architecture
- Overall structure and organization
- Key architectural patterns identified
- Important directories and their purposes

### Tech Stack
- Languages and versions
- Frameworks and major libraries
- Build tools and package managers
- Testing frameworks

### Technology Research Status
- Profiles available in `.agents/reference/`: [list or "none"]
- Technologies covered: [list]
- `/research-stack` status: [Complete / Not Run]

### Development Progress
- Active PRD phase: [Phase N or "No PRD"]
- Plans created: [list or "none"]
- Latest validation: [date and result or "none"]
- Progress tracking: [`.agents/progress/` status or "no active execution"]

### Execution Memory
- Memory files found: [list or "none"]
- Key learnings from previous phases: [brief summary of deviations, patterns, recovery actions]
- Validation history: [pass rates, recurring failure patterns, or "no validations yet"]

### Core Principles
- Code style and conventions observed
- Documentation standards
- Testing approach

### Current State
- Active branch
- Recent changes or development focus
- Any immediate observations or concerns

### Recommended Next Step
Based on the project state, suggest the next PIV command:
- No PRD? → "Run `/create-prd` to define requirements"
- PRD exists, no profiles? → "Run `/research-stack` to research technologies"
- Profiles exist, no plans? → "Run `/plan-feature \"Phase 1\"` to start planning"
- Plan exists, not executed? → "Run `/execute .agents/plans/[plan].md`"
- Executed, not validated? → "Run `/validate-implementation`"
- Validated? → "Run `/commit` to ship"

### Reasoning

Output 4-8 bullets summarizing what you found during analysis. Place this BEFORE the Project Overview section in terminal output. Example:

```
### Reasoning
- Scanned [N] tracked files, [N] directories
- PRD found at [path], currently on Phase [N]
- [N] technology profiles available, [N] plans created
- Last commit [date]: [summary]
- Gap: [observation, if any]
```

### Reflection

After generating the full report, output a brief self-critique to terminal:
- Is this summary complete and accurate?
- Did I miss context from CLAUDE.md, PRD, or recent commits?
- Is my recommended next step correct given the project state?

Format:

```
### Reflection
- ✅/⚠️ [Finding]
- ✅/⚠️ [Finding]
```

### PIV-Automator-Hooks (If Enabled)

If hooks are enabled, append to terminal output:

```
## PIV-Automator-Hooks
current_phase: [define|research|planning|executing|validating|shipping]
completed_phases: [comma-separated list]
pending_items: [brief description]
recommended_next_command: [command name without /]
recommended_arg: "[argument string]"
requires_clear_before_next: [true|false]
confidence: [high|medium|low]
```

**Make this summary easy to scan - use bullet points and clear headers.**
